Sketch of [flow diagram](/wiki/Flow_diagram "Flow diagram") for continuous integration


**Continuous integration** (**CI**) is the practice of integrating [source code](/wiki/Source_code "Source code") changes frequently and ensuring that the integrated codebase is in a workable state.


Typically, developers [merge](/wiki/Merge_(version_control) "Merge (version control)") changes to an [integration branch](/wiki/Branching_(revision_control) "Branching (revision control)"), and an automated system [builds](/wiki/Software_build "Software build") and [tests](/wiki/Software_testing "Software testing") the [software system](/wiki/Software_system "Software system").[[1]](#cite_note-martinfowler-1) 
Often, the automated process runs on each [commit](/wiki/Commit_(version_control) "Commit (version control)") or runs on a schedule such as once a day. 


[Grady Booch](/wiki/Grady_Booch "Grady Booch") first proposed the term CI in [1991](/wiki/Booch_method "Booch method"),[[2]](#cite_note-2) although he did not advocate integrating multiple times a day, but later, CI came to include that aspect.[[3]](#cite_note-3)




History[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Continuous_integration&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: History")]

| --- | --- |


The earliest known work on continuous integration was the Infuse environment developed by G. E. Kaiser, D. E. Perry, and W. M. Schell.[[4]](#cite_note-4)


In 1994, Grady Booch used the phrase continuous integration in *Object-Oriented Analysis and Design with Applications* (2nd edition)[[5]](#cite_note-5) to explain how, when developing using micro processes, "internal releases represent a sort of continuous integration of the system, and exist to force closure of the micro process".


In 1997, [Kent Beck](/wiki/Kent_Beck "Kent Beck") and [Ron Jeffries](/wiki/Ron_Jeffries "Ron Jeffries") invented [extreme programming](/wiki/Extreme_programming "Extreme programming") (XP) while on the [Chrysler Comprehensive Compensation System](/wiki/Chrysler_Comprehensive_Compensation_System "Chrysler Comprehensive Compensation System") project, including continuous integration.[[1]](#cite_note-martinfowler-1)[*[self-published source](/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability#Self-published_sources "Wikipedia:Verifiability")*] Beck published about continuous integration in 1998, emphasising the importance of face-to-face communication over technological support.[[6]](#cite_note-6) In 1999, Beck elaborated more in his first full book on Extreme Programming.[[7]](#cite_note-Beck,_Extreme_Programming_Explained-7) [CruiseControl](/wiki/CruiseControl "CruiseControl"), one of the first open-source CI tools,[[8]](#cite_note-8)[*[self-published source](/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability#Self-published_sources "Wikipedia:Verifiability")*] was released in 2001.


In 2010, Timothy Fitz published an article detailing how [IMVU](/wiki/IMVU "IMVU")'s engineering team had built and been using the first practical CI system. While his post was originally met with skepticism, it quickly caught on and found widespread adoption[[9]](#cite_note-9) as part of the [lean software development](/wiki/Lean_software_development "Lean software development") methodology, also based on IMVU.



Practices[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Continuous_integration&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Practices")]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


The core activities of CI are developers co-locate code changes in a shared, integration area frequently and that the resulting integrated codebase is verified for correctness. The first part generally involves merging changes to a common version control branch. The second part generally involves automated processes including: building, testing and many other processes.


Typically, a [server](/wiki/Server_(computing) "Server (computing)") builds from the integration area frequently; i.e. after each commit or periodically like once a day. The server may perform [quality control](/wiki/Quality_control "Quality control") checks such as running unit tests[[10]](#cite_note-10) and collect [software quality](/wiki/Software_quality "Software quality") metrics via processes such as static analysis and performance testing.

This section lists [best practices](/wiki/Best_practice "Best practice") from practitioners for other practices that enhance CI.



### Build automation[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Continuous_integration&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Build automation")]


[Build automation](/wiki/Build_automation "Build automation") is a best practice.[[11]](#cite_note-Brauneis,_[OSLC]_Possible_new_Working_Group_-_Automation-11)[[12]](#cite_note-Taylor,_Rails_Deployment_and_Automation_with_ShadowPuppet_and_Capistrano-12)



### Atomic commits[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Continuous_integration&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Atomic commits")]


CI requires the version control system to support [atomic commits](/wiki/Atomic_commit "Atomic commit"); i.e., all of a developer's changes are handled as a single commit.



### Committing changes[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Continuous_integration&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Committing changes")]


When making a code change, a [developer](/wiki/Software_developer "Software developer") creates a branch that is a copy of the current [codebase](/wiki/Codebase "Codebase"). As other changes are committed to the [repository](/wiki/Source_code_repository "Source code repository"), this copy diverges from the latest version.


The longer development continues on a branch without merging to the integration branch, the greater the risk of multiple integration conflicts[[13]](#cite_note-13) and failures when the developer branch is eventually merged back. When developers submit code to the repository they must first update their code to reflect the changes in the repository since they took their copy. The more changes the repository contains, the more work developers must do before submitting their own changes.


Eventually, the repository may become so different from the developers' baselines that they enter what is sometimes referred to as "merge hell", or "integration hell",[[14]](#cite_note-Cunningham,_Integration_Hell-14) where the time it takes to integrate exceeds the time it took to make their original changes.[[15]](#cite_note-15)



### Testing locally[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Continuous_integration&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Testing locally")]


Proponents of CI suggest that developers should 
use [test-driven development](/wiki/Test-driven_development "Test-driven development") and to
ensure that all [unit tests](/wiki/Unit_testing "Unit testing") pass locally before committing to the integration branch so that one developer's work does not break another developer's copy. 


Incomplete features can be disabled before committing, using [feature toggles](/wiki/Feature_toggle "Feature toggle").



### Continuous delivery and continuous deployment[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Continuous_integration&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Continuous delivery and continuous deployment")]


[Continuous delivery](/wiki/Continuous_delivery "Continuous delivery") ensures the software checked in on an integration branch is always in a state that can be deployed to users, and [continuous deployment](/wiki/Continuous_deployment "Continuous deployment") automates the deployment process.


*Continuous delivery* and *continuous deployment* are often performed in conjunction with CI and together form a CI/CD pipeline. 



### Version control[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Continuous_integration&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: Version control")]


Main article: [Version control](/wiki/Version_control "Version control")
Proponents of CI recommend storing all files and information needed for building in [version control](/wiki/Version_control "Version control"), (for [git](/wiki/Git "Git") a *repository*); that the system should be buildable from a fresh checkout and not require additional dependencies. 


[Martin Fowler](/wiki/Martin_Fowler_(software_engineer) "Martin Fowler (software engineer)") recommends that all developers commit to the same integration branch.[[16]](#cite_note-Fowler,_Continuous_Integration_practices-16)



### Automate the build[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Continuous_integration&action=edit&section=10 "Edit section: Automate the build")]


Main article: [Build automation](/wiki/Build_automation "Build automation")
[Build automation tools](/wiki/List_of_build_automation_software "List of build automation software") automate building. 


Proponents of CI recommend that a single command should have the capability of building the system. 


Automation often includes automating the integration, which often includes [deployment](/wiki/Software_deployment "Software deployment") into a production-like [environment](/wiki/Deployment_environment "Deployment environment"). In many cases, the build script not only compiles binaries but also generates documentation, website pages, statistics and distribution media (such as Debian [DEB](/wiki/Deb_(file_format) "Deb (file format)"), Red Hat [RPM](/wiki/RPM_Package_Manager "RPM Package Manager") or Windows [MSI](/wiki/Microsoft_Installer "Microsoft Installer") files).



### Commit frequently[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Continuous_integration&action=edit&section=11 "Edit section: Commit frequently")]


Developers can reduce the effort of resolving conflicting changes by synchronizing changes with each other frequently; at least daily. Checking in a week's worth of work risks conflict both in likelihood of occurrence and complexity to resolve. Relatively small conflicts are significantly easier to resolve than larger ones. Integrating (committing) changes at least once a day is considered good practice, and more often better.[[17]](#cite_note-17)



### Daily build[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Continuous_integration&action=edit&section=12 "Edit section: Daily build")]


[Building daily](/wiki/Daily_build "Daily build"), if not more often, is generally recommended.[*[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")*]



### Every commit should be built[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Continuous_integration&action=edit&section=13 "Edit section: Every commit should be built")]


The system should build commits to the current working version to verify that they integrate correctly. A common practice is to use Automated Continuous Integration, although this may be done manually. Automated Continuous Integration employs a continuous integration server or [daemon](/wiki/Daemon_(computer_software) "Daemon (computer software)") to monitor the [revision control system](/wiki/Revision_control "Revision control") for changes, then automatically run the build process.



### Every bug-fix commit should come with a test case[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Continuous_integration&action=edit&section=14 "Edit section: Every bug-fix commit should come with a test case")]


When fixing a bug, it is a good practice to push a test case that reproduces the bug. This avoids the fix to be reverted, and the bug to reappear, which is known as a [regression](/wiki/Regression_testing "Regression testing").



### Keep the build fast[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Continuous_integration&action=edit&section=15 "Edit section: Keep the build fast")]


The build needs to complete rapidly so that if there is a problem with integration, it is quickly identified.



### Test in a clone of the production environment[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Continuous_integration&action=edit&section=16 "Edit section: Test in a clone of the production environment")]


Main article: [Test environment](/wiki/Test_environment "Test environment")
Having a [test environment](/wiki/Test_environment "Test environment") can lead to failures in tested systems when they deploy in the [production environment](/wiki/Production_environment "Production environment") because the production environment may differ from the test environment in a significant way. However, building a replica of a production environment is cost-prohibitive. Instead, the test environment or a separate [pre-production environment](/wiki/Pre-production_environment "Pre-production environment") ("staging") should be built to be a scalable version of the production environment to alleviate costs while maintaining [technology stack](/wiki/Technology_stack "Technology stack") composition and nuances. Within these test environments, [service virtualisation](/wiki/Service_virtualisation "Service virtualisation") is commonly used to obtain on-demand access to dependencies (e.g., APIs, third-party applications, services, [mainframes](/wiki/Mainframe_computer "Mainframe computer"), etc.) that are beyond the team's control, still evolving, or too complex to configure in a virtual test lab.



### Make it easy to get the latest deliverables[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Continuous_integration&action=edit&section=17 "Edit section: Make it easy to get the latest deliverables")]


Making builds readily available to stakeholders and testers can reduce the amount of rework necessary when rebuilding a feature that doesn't meet requirements. Additionally, early testing reduces the chances that defects survive until deployment. Finding errors earlier can reduce the amount of work necessary to resolve them.


All programmers should start the day by updating the project from the repository. That way, they will all stay up to date.



### Everyone can see the results of the latest build[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Continuous_integration&action=edit&section=18 "Edit section: Everyone can see the results of the latest build")]


It should be easy to find out whether the build breaks and, if so, who made the relevant change and what that change was.



### Automate deployment[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Continuous_integration&action=edit&section=19 "Edit section: Automate deployment")]


Most CI systems allow the running of scripts after a build finishes. In most situations, it is possible to write a script to deploy the application to a live test server that everyone can look at. A further advance in this way of thinking is [continuous deployment](/wiki/Continuous_deployment "Continuous deployment"), which calls for the software to be deployed directly into production, often with additional automation to prevent defects or regressions.[[18]](#cite_note-18)[[19]](#cite_note-19)

CI benefits include:



* Facilitates detecting [bugs](/wiki/Software_bug "Software bug") earlier
* Reduces effort to find cause of bugs; if a CI test fails then changes since last good build contain causing change; if build after each change then exactly one change is the cause[[1]](#cite_note-martinfowler-1)
* Avoids the chaos of integrating many changes
* When a test fails or a bug is found, reverting the codebase to a good state results in fewer lost changes
* Frequent availability of a known-good build for testing, demo, and release
* Frequent code commit encourages modular, less complex code[[20]](#cite_note-20)
* Quick feedback on system-wide impact of code changes
* Supports collection of [software metrics](/wiki/Software_metrics "Software metrics") such as [code coverage](/wiki/Code_coverage "Code coverage"), [code complexity](/wiki/Code_complexity "Code complexity")


Risks[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Continuous_integration&action=edit&section=21 "Edit section: Risks")]
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Risks of CI include:



* [Build system](/wiki/Build_system "Build system") setup requires effort[[21]](#cite_note-21)
* Writing and maintaining an automated test suite requires effort
* Value added depends on the quality of tests[[22]](#cite_note-:1-22)
* High build latency (sitting in queue) limits value[[22]](#cite_note-:1-22)
* Implies that incomplete code should not be integrated which is counter to some developer's preferred practice[[22]](#cite_note-:1-22)
* Safety and mission-critical development assurance (e.g., [DO-178C](/wiki/DO-178C "DO-178C"), [ISO 26262](/wiki/ISO_26262 "ISO 26262")) require documentation and review which may be difficult to achieve
