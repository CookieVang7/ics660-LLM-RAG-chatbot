Management fad is a term used to characterize a change in philosophy or operations implemented by a business or institution. It amounts to a fad in the management culture of an institution. 

The term is subjective and tends to be used in a pejorative sense, as it implies that such a change is being implemented (often by management on its employees, with little or no input from them) solely because it is (at the time) "popular" within managerial circles, and not necessarily due to any real need for organizational change. The term further implies that once the underlying philosophy is no longer "popular", it will be replaced by the newest "popular" idea, in the same manner and for the same reason as the previous idea.

Alternatively, the pejorative use of the term expresses a cynical belief that the organization desires change that would be resisted by the rank and file if presented directly, so it is dressed up in a dramatic change of management style, to remain in place only as long as it serves the underlying agenda. 

Several authors have argued that new management ideas should be subject to greater critical analysis, and for the need for greater conceptual awareness of new ideas by managers.[1] Authors Leonard J. Ponzi and Michael Koenig believe that a key determinant of whether any management idea is a "management fad" is the number and timing of published articles on the idea. In their research,[2] Ponzi and Koenig argue that once an idea has been discussed for around 3â€“5 years, if after this time the number of articles on the idea in a given year decreases significantly (similar to the right-hand side of a bell curve), then the idea is most likely a "management fad".

Management fads are often characterized by the following:

New jargon for existing business processes.
External consultants who specialize in the implementation of the fad.
A certification or appraisal process performed by an external agency for a fee.
Amending the job titles of existing employees to include references to the fad.
Claims of a measurable business improvement via measurement of a metric (e.g. key performance indicator) that is defined by the fad itself.
An internal sponsoring department or individual that gains influence due to the fad's implementation.
Big words and complex phrases (puffery).
Consultants and even academics have developed new management ideas. Journalists may popularize new concepts.[3]

Like other fashions, trends in management thought may grow, decline, and recur. Judy Wajcman sees the human relations movement of the 1930s as a precursor of the later fashion of "transformational management".[4]
